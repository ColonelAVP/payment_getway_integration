Sainik Aadhar Fund is a non-profit, non-governmental organization focused on providing financial support to
members of the Armed Forces (including Para Military Forces) and their dependents. In past 5 years,
over 20000 families have received financial aid from us. Sainik Aadhar Fund was set up to take charge of voluntary donations in cash. 
The Fund was created to pay a small tribute to all the soldiers who lost their lives in battlefield protecting the country.
